Being at parties and embarrasing ourselves with friends in front of a photo booth is always great fun.
Whether it is a wedding or a birthday party, these automatically shooting boxes take an event from ten to elven.
And because it is so much fun, I asked a photo booth rental company how much it is for a single day.
Well.. It's simply too expensive I thought, so I started to build one myself.
So I collected all the equipment I owned, put it together, wrote some lines of code and finally, after a couple of party iterations and bug fixing I have my own working photo booth.

In this post I want to describe my setup, the troubles I had and provide some useful links so that you can make your own photo booth as well. Let's start!

# The Ingredients
So let's begin with all the necessary equipment you need:
- Camera (Canon EOS 500D)
